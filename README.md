## Brent's Porfolio
This page is for me to use throughout my life and career in the field of information technology and cybersecurity. As I continue throughout my journey in school and in my career, I will continue to update this website as if it were a live, online resume. Right now, I am stil in the process of going through school so my education and personal accomplishments are still a work in progress but there are hopefully many more to come. Throughout my journey on my way to a degree, I will continue to update this page wtih projects that I have done as I already have some smaller projects on this page that I would like to show off.
